# Machine-Learning---Multiple-Linear-Regression
Machine Learning -> Multiple Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the linear relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. In this project, I built a model to predict vehicle CO2 emissions based on features like engine size from a Canadian fuel consumption dataset.
